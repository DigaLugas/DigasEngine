# Digas3D Engine

This is a simple 3D graphics engine built using C++ and the OneLoneCoder ConsoleGameEngine.

## Description

Digas3D Engine is a basic 3D graphics engine that renders 3D objects in a console window using ASCII characters. It provides a foundation for learning about 3D graphics programming and can serve as a starting point for creating more complex applications.

## Features

- Rendering of basic 3D objects (currently limited to cubes)
- Rotation and projection of 3D objects
- Simple user interface using the console window


## Dependencies

To run the Digas3D Engine, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- **C++ Compiler**: You need a C++ compiler to compile the source code.
- **OneLoneCoder ConsoleGameEngine**: This project relies on the OneLoneCoder ConsoleGameEngine library for rendering graphics in the console window. You can find the library and installation instructions [here](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/tree/master/OneLoneCoder_ConsoleGameEngine).

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured properly before attempting to compile and run the Digas3D Engine.


## Getting Started

To run the Digas3D Engine, you need a C++ compiler and the OneLoneCoder ConsoleGameEngine library. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `GraphicEngine.cpp` file using your C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys to rotate the 3D object.
- Press `ESC` to exit the program.
